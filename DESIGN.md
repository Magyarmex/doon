# Doon Vision Document

## Core Vision
- Deliver a fully traversable, atmospheric 3D labyrinth that invites players to explore at their own pace while staying alert for sudden danger.
- Encourage deliberate marksmanship with a rugged bolt-action rifle that rewards timing and accuracy over spray-and-pray tactics.
- Blend oppressive industrial corridors with surreal open caverns to evoke the mystery of early experimental 3D shooters.
- Keep players thinking vertically with foes and secrets placed both above and below the eye line, making pitch control meaningful.
- Pace tension through scarce ammunition, methodical reloading, and encounters that force thoughtful positioning.

## Aesthetic Direction
- Embrace chunky, low-resolution textures and bold color blocks reminiscent of retro horror shooters.
- Use stark lighting contrasts—deep shadows pierced by bright neon indicators—to guide the player without breaking immersion.
- Present enemies as unsettling silhouettes that resolve into angular, abstract shapes when approached.
- Let environmental storytelling shine through set dressing such as rusted railings, decayed consoles, and ritualistic markings.

## Player Fantasy
- Feel like a lone surveyor uncovering forbidden spaces armed with a dependable bolt-action rifle.
- Experience quiet exploration punctuated by decisive, high-impact shots that echo through vast chambers.
- Master spatial awareness by combining lateral movement with controlled vertical aiming.

## Expansion Hook
- The vision in this document should only be added to with the ideas of the user.
- Future additions should heighten tension and wonder, building on exploration, verticality, and marksmanship.
